## Overview

The world of Rendel is enigmatic. It's layered with secrets that are ready to be uncovered. The plot of EOD starts with a clich√© but develops into a unique and subjective story telling experience. Some of the concepts present in the game will be abstract and players will be able to interpret them however they wish. This provides a uniqueness to the game experience for each player.

The player assumes the role of a warrior who has lost his memories and is on a quest to regain them. During the course of game, players will discover many dark secrets of Rendel and come across some key events that will affect the game plot. Players will be free to make their own decisions to influence the game world and story outcome. 

Players will experience the game from a 3rd person perspective which is required for the game's combat system to be engaging. A player will be able to attack, dodge, and block enemy attacks in real time. Player skill will be a deciding factor in determining the outcome of a combat. 

## Unique Selling Points

### Combat System
The combat system of EOD will be designed to reward player skill. The better a player performs, the better reward a player will reap. It's the constant desire of a player to perform better at the combat that will keep them hooked.

### Overpowering Your Foes
EOD's world is meant to make the player feel small and weak. The monsters are supposed to intimidate players. But despite that, with right amount of skill and strategy, players can overpower any foe in any situation. This does imply that the RPG stats and numbers will be less of a deciding factor in the outcome of a battle.

### Sparing your foes
It is not necessary for the player to eliminate their enemies. The player can choose the pacifist route if they so desire
